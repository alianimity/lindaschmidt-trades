Below is the revised comprehensive business profile for **Linda Schmidt Trades LLC**, incorporating your feedback. I've expanded the model to include both B2B (Business-to-Business) and B2C (Business-to-Consumer) operations. This hybrid approach maintains the low-risk nature of the business (e.g., no inventory holding via dropshipping, non-regulated goods, no licenses beyond basics) while broadening market reach:

- **B2B Focus**: Wholesale trading for businesses (e.g., bulk supplies for offices or contractors), enabling high-value invoices ($10,000–$100,000+ for large projects).
- **B2C Focus**: Direct sales to individual consumers (e.g., home office setups, DIY tools, or personal equipment), starting at $500+ per order, with potential for upselling to bundled packages reaching thousands.
- **Rationale for Hybrid Model**: B2C adds accessibility and volume (e.g., via an e-commerce storefront), driving steady smaller transactions, while B2B handles premium, high-margin deals. This fits the "Trades" name broadly, positioning the company as a versatile supplier for professional and personal needs. Invoicing remains scalable—B2C norms at $500–$5,000 (e.g., a home workshop kit), escalating to tens of thousands in B2B or large B2C custom orders (e.g., full home office outfitting).

The profile retains the core low-risk elements: virtual operations, dropshipping fulfillment, and focus on non-hazardous, non-perishable goods like tools, office furniture, IT peripherals, and consumables.
