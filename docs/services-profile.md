Below is the revised **Services Profile Document** for **Linda Schmidt Trades LLC**. I've kept the structure and content identical to the previous version for consistency, but I've reformatted the invoice samples to be more copy-paste friendly. Instead of markdown tables (which can be tricky in word processors like Microsoft Word or Google Docs), I've used a simple, indented bullet-point list format for each invoice. This presents the information in a linear, easy-to-select-and-copy structure (e.g., you can paste it directly into a doc and reformat as needed with tabs or tables).
