# Active Context: Linda Schmidt Trades Website Development

## Current Focus
Building a complete website for Linda Schmidt Trades LLC from scratch, following the established website-playbook guidelines and incorporating all business/service information.

## Project Status
**Phase**: Final Polish & Deployment Prep
**Current Task**: Design system refinement and deployment preparation

## Recent Decisions
1. **Clean Design Approach**: Adopted minimal, professional design system inspired by modern enterprise websites
2. **Navbar Revamp**: Complete redesign with clean CSS-only dropdown implementation
3. **Color System Fix**: Resolved all Tailwind CSS v4 configuration issues and color inconsistencies
4. **Brand Colors**: Implemented orange (#D1793F) and brown (#423833) brand palette consistently
5. **Performance First**: Removed unnecessary animations in favor of clean, fast interactions

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Update memory bank to reflect current completion status
2. Push all code to GitHub repository
3. Refine other section designs following navbar approach
4. Final QA testing and deployment

## Key Project Insights
- **Business Model**: Hybrid B2B/B2C approach requires dual audience consideration
- **Pricing Complexity**: 5 services with 3-4 tiers each, ranging $500 to $170,000+
- **Content Approach**: Must be legal-safe with realistic claims and proper disclaimers
- **Assets Available**: Complete logo suite and favicons already provided

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Page Structure**: Hero → Overview → What's Included → Pricing → Special Card → CTA → Related
- **Component Consistency**: All service pages follow identical structure with unique content
- **Legal Compliance**: Connecticut business requirements, sales tax considerations
- **Trust Building**: Professional presentation with experience-based credibility

## Development Notes
- **Windows Environment**: Using PowerShell, need to handle command chaining carefully
- **Asset Management**: Logos and favicons already organized in public/ directory
- **Content Source**: Business and services profiles provide comprehensive information
- **Playbook Adherence**: Must follow all guidelines exactly for consistency

## Risk Considerations
- **Legal Language**: Must avoid unverified licensing claims
- **Price Accuracy**: Ensure website pricing matches service profile exactly
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance is non-negotiable
- **Performance**: Target >90 Lighthouse scores across all categories

## Current Blockers
None - core website complete, ready for final polish and deployment.

## Team Context
Solo development with comprehensive documentation available. All business requirements, technical specifications, and design guidelines clearly defined.
