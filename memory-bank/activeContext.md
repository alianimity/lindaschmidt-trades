# Active Context: Linda Schmidt Trades Website Development

## Current Focus
Building a complete website for Linda Schmidt Trades LLC from scratch, following the established website-playbook guidelines and incorporating all business/service information.

## Project Status
**Phase**: Ready for Legal Pages, QA, and Deployment
**Current Task**: Completing final requirements before production launch

## Recent Decisions & Completed Work
1. **Clean Design Approach**: Adopted minimal, professional design system with consistent brand application
2. **Navbar Revamp**: Professional CSS-only dropdown with transparent-to-solid scroll transition
3. **Color System**: Complete resolution of Tailwind v4 configuration with proper brand color implementation
4. **Brand Colors**: Consistent orange (#D1793F) and brown (#423833) throughout all components
5. **Performance Optimization**: Removed excessive animations, optimized for faster load times
6. **Service Customization**: Unique stats cards and realistic pricing ranges for each service
7. **Client Component Fix**: Resolved metadata export conflicts for service pages
8. **FAQ Redesign**: Side-by-side layout for better content organization

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Create legal compliance pages (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy)
2. Comprehensive QA testing (accessibility, performance, functionality)
3. Production deployment to Vercel
4. Final live testing and optimization

## Key Project Insights
- **Business Model**: Hybrid B2B/B2C approach requires dual audience consideration
- **Pricing Complexity**: 5 services with 3-4 tiers each, ranging $500 to $170,000+
- **Content Approach**: Must be legal-safe with realistic claims and proper disclaimers
- **Assets Available**: Complete logo suite and favicons already provided

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Page Structure**: Hero → Overview → What's Included → Pricing → Special Card → CTA → Related
- **Component Consistency**: All service pages follow identical structure with unique content
- **Legal Compliance**: Connecticut business requirements, sales tax considerations
- **Trust Building**: Professional presentation with experience-based credibility

## Development Notes
- **Windows Environment**: Using PowerShell, need to handle command chaining carefully
- **Asset Management**: Logos and favicons already organized in public/ directory
- **Content Source**: Business and services profiles provide comprehensive information
- **Playbook Adherence**: Must follow all guidelines exactly for consistency

## Risk Considerations
- **Legal Language**: Must avoid unverified licensing claims
- **Price Accuracy**: Ensure website pricing matches service profile exactly
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance is non-negotiable
- **Performance**: Target >90 Lighthouse scores across all categories

## Current Blockers
None - core website development complete. Ready for legal pages, QA testing, and deployment.

## Team Context
Solo development with comprehensive documentation available. All business requirements, technical specifications, and design guidelines clearly defined.
